Running
=======

This page gives information on how to run *NekRS* after it has been installed (see :ref:`Installation instructions <installing>` ) and appropriate input files have been generated 
(see :ref:`case`).

Native Running
--------------

To run *NekRS* natively from the directory containing the :ref:`case`, use the following general command

.. code-block::

    mpirun -np <number of MPI tasks> nekrs --setup <par|sess file> [options]

Below are the command line options/argument that can be used to further modifiy how *NekRS* is run.

.. _nekrs_scripts:

MPI launch scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of scripts ship with *NekRS* itself and are located in the ``$NEKRS_HOME/bin``. A brief summary of these scripts and their usage is as follows.

* ``nrsmpi <casename> <processes>``: run *NekRS* in parallel with ``<processes>`` parallel processes for the case files that are prefixed with ``casename``.
* ``nrsbmpi <casename> <processes>``: same as ``nrsmpi``, except that nekRS runs in the background and the output is printed to log file

Running on HPC Systems

Specific scripts and instructions for running on specific HPC systems can be found `in nekRS_HPCsupport Github repository <https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS_HPCsupport>`_
