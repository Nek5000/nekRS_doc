Introduction

This section will introduce some main concepts that are needed to setup cases in
nekRS.

.. _nondimensional:

Solving in Dimensional vs Non-Dimensional Form
----------------------------------------------

It is often advantageous to solve these equations in non-dimensional form
because non-dimensional formulation can simplify the simulation input parameters
and provide more numerical stability. Here, we introduce the non-dimensional
form in as general a manner as possible, assuming the use of variable material
properties for density, viscosity, specific heat capacity, and thermal
conductivity that are functions of temperature:
:math:`\rho=\rho(T)`, :math:`\mu=\mu(T)`, :math:`C_p=C_p(T)`, and :math:`k=k(T)`.
For simplicity, the functional notation is omitted throughout. 
:ref:`Table 1 <characteristic_quantities>` provides some basic parameters for 
nondimensionalization in nekRS.

  ================== ============================ ==================================================

Below are the nondimensional parameter in reference to table 
:ref:`Table 1 <characteristic_quantities>`.

.. math::

  x^* = \frac{x}{D}, \quad u^* = \frac{u}{U},
  \quad t^* = \frac{tU}{D}, \quad P^* = \frac{P}{\rho_0 U^2}, 
  \quad T^* = \frac{T - T_0}{\Delta T}, \quad  \rho^* = \frac{\rho}{\rho_0}

Here, a subscript of * denotes nondimensionalized parameter, a subscript of 0
indicates that the property is evaluated at :math:`T_0`. Inserting these
non-dimensional variables into the mass and momentum conservation equations gives: 

.. math:: 
  
  \rho^* \rho_0 \left( \frac{\partial (u^* U)}{\partial (t^* (D/U))} + \frac{u^* U}{D} \cdot \nabla u^* U \right) = -\frac{1}{D} \nabla \left(P^* (\rho_0 U^2)\right) + \frac{1}{D} \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\mu}{D} \left(\nabla(u^* U) + \nabla(u^* U)^T \right)\right) + \rho f

.. math:: 
  
  \frac{1}{D} \nabla\cdot(u^* U)=-\frac{1}{\rho^* \rho_o } \left(\frac{\partial(\rho^* \rho_o)}{\partial(t^* (D/U))}+\frac{1}{D} u^* U\cdot\nabla(\rho^* \rho_o)\right)

Which is equivalent to

.. math:: \rho^* \left(\frac{\partial u^*}{\partial t^*} + u^* \cdot \nabla u^*\right) = -\nabla P^* + \nabla \cdot \frac{1}{Re} \left(\nabla u^* + (\nabla u^*)^T\right) + f^* \rho^*
   :label: eq_1

.. math:: \nabla \cdot u^* = -\frac{1}{\rho^*} \left(\frac{\partial \rho^*}{\partial t^*} + u^* \cdot \nabla \rho^*\right)
   :label: eq_2

Where :math:`Re = \frac{D U \rho_0}{\mu}`, :math:`f^* = \frac{fD}{U^2}`. In 
equation :eq:`eq_1` and :eq:`eq_2`, :math:`\nabla`` are expanded to explicitly
show that all derivatives are taken with respect to the nondimensional space
variable :math:`x^*`.

To non-dimensionalize the energy conservation equation, use the previous 
non-dimensional variables in addition to a non-dimensional temperature, 
:math:`T^*=\frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}`. The heat source is non-dimensionalized as 
:math:`\dot{q}^*=\frac{\dot{q}}{\rho_0 C_{p0} U\Delta T/D}`, which arises
naturally from the simple formulation of bulk energy conservation of 
:math:`Q=\dot{m}C_p\Delta T`, where :math:`Q`` is a heat source (units of Watts)
and :math:`\dot{m}`` is a mass flowrate. Inserting these non-dimensional 
variables into the energy conservation equation gives

.. math::

  \rho^* \rho_0 \left(\frac{\partial(T^* \Delta T)}{\partial(t^* (D/U))}+\frac{u^* U}{D}\cdot\nabla(T^* \Delta T)\right)=\frac{1}{D^2} \nabla\cdot\frac{k}{c_p} \nabla(T^* \Delta T)

Which is equivalent to

.. math::

  \rho^* \left(\frac{\partial T^*}{\partial t^*} + \mathbf{u}^* \cdot \nabla T^*\right) = \nabla \cdot (\alpha^* \nabla T^*) + \dot{q}^*

where the nondimensional thermal diffusivity :math:`\alpha^* = 1/Pe`. Pe is the
Peclet number, :math:`Pe = \frac{DU}{\alpha}` and :math:`\alpha`` is the 
dimensional thermal diffusivity, :math:`\alpha = \frac{k_0}{\rho_0 C_{p,0}}`.

An example of nondimensionalization for the :ref:`fdlf` tutorial is given in
table :ref:`channel_nondimension`.

Adapting to nekRS
"""""""""""""""""

nekRS can solve its governing equations in either dimensional or non-dimensional form
with careful attention to the specification of the material properties. To solve in
*dimensional* form, the ``density``, ``viscosity``, ``rhoCp``, ``conductivity``, and
``diffusivity`` parameters in the ``.par`` file simply take dimensional forms. Solving
in *non-dimensional* form requires only small changes from the dimensional approach.
For the case of constant properties, the transformation to non-dimensional form is
trivial, but slightly more care is required to solve in non-dimensional form with
variable properties. These two approaches are described next with reference to
the incompressible Navier-Stokes model described in :ref:`ins_model`.

It is recommended to use non-dimensional solves and the other sections of the
documentation will use this as a default.

.. _constant_p:

Constant Properties
"""""""""""""""""""

For the case of constant properties for :math:`\rho`, :math:`\mu`, :math:`C_p`,
and :math:`k`, solution in non-dimensional form is achieved by simply specifying
the non-dimensionalized version of these properties in the ``.par`` file. To be explicit,
for the momentum and energy conservation equations, the input parameters should be specified as:

  * ``rho``:math:`\rightarrow` :math:`\rho^\dagger\equiv\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}`
  * ``viscosity``:math:`\rightarrow` :math:`\frac{1}{Re}\mu^\dagger\equiv\frac{\mu_0}{\rho_0UL}\frac{\mu}{\mu_0}`
  * ``rhoCp``:math:`\rightarrow` :math:`\rho^\dagger C_p^\dagger\equiv\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\frac{C_p}{C_{p,0}}`
  * ``conductivity``:math:`\rightarrow` :math:`\frac{1}{Pe}k^\dagger\equiv\frac{k_0}{\rho_0C_{p,0}UL}\frac{k}{k_0}`

For the :math:`k` and :math:`\tau` equations, if present, the input parameters for
*both* the :math:`k` equation should be specified as:

  * ``rho``:math:`\rightarrow`:math:`1.0`
  * ``diffusivity``:math:`\rightarrow`:math:`\frac{1}{Re}`

Notice that these non-dimensional forms for the :math:`k` and :math:`\tau` equations
are slightly simpler than the forms for the mean momentum and energy equations - this
occurs because nekRS's :math:`k`-:math:`\tau` model is restricted to constant-property
flows, so we do not need to consider :math:`\rho^\dagger\neq 1` or
:math:`\mu^\dagger\neq 1`.

If a volumetric heat source is present, it must also be specified in non-dimensional form
as

.. math::

  \dot{q}^\dagger=\frac{\dot{q}}{\rho_0C_{p,0}U\Delta T/L}

If a source term is present in the momentum conservation equation, that source term
must also be specified in non-dimensional form as

.. math::

   \mathbf s^\dagger=\frac{\mathbf s}{\rho_0U^2/L}

where :math:`\mathbf s` is the source term in the dimensional equation, with dimensions
of mass / square length / square time.

In addition, all boundary conditions must also be non-dimensionalized appropriately.
Some of the more common boundary conditions and their non-dimensionalizations are:

  * fixed velocity: :math:`u_i^\dagger=\frac{u_i}{U}`, i.e. divide all dimensional
    velocity boundary values by :math:`U`
  * fixed temperature: :math:`T^\dagger=\frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}`, i.e. from all dimensional temperature
    boundary values, first subtract :math:`T_0` and then divide by :math:`\Delta T`
  * fixed pressure: :math:`P^\dagger=\frac{P}{\rho_0U^2}`, i.e. divide all dimensional
    pressure boundary values by :math:`\rho_0U^2`
  * heat flux: :math:`q^\dagger=\frac{q}{\rho_0C_{p,0}U\Delta T}`, i.e. divide all
    dimensional heat flux boundary values by :math:`\rho_0C_{p,0}U\Delta T`
  * turbulent kinetic energy: :math:`k^\dagger=\frac{k}{U^2}`, i.e. divide the dimensional
    turbulent kinetic energy by :math:`U^2`
  * inverse specific dissipation rate: :math:`\tau^\dagger=\frac{\tau}{L/U}`, i.e.
    divide the dimensional inverse specific dissipation rate by :math:`L/U`

If the Prandtl number is unity, then because :math:`Pe\equiv Re\ Pr`, the coefficient on the
diffusion kernel in both the momentum and energy conservation equations will be the same
(for the case of constant properties).

.. note::

  Several of the nekRS input files use syntax inherited from Nek5000 that allows shorthand
  expressions that are often convenient for the Reynolds and Peclet numbers, which appear
  as inverses in the non-dimensional equations. Specifying ``conductivity = -1000`` is
  shorthand for ``conductivity = 1/1000``.

Variable Properties
"""""""""""""""""""

For the case of variable properties, the procedure is similar to the case for constant
properties, except that the properties must be specified in the ``.oudf`` kernels.
It is best practice to simply omit the ``rho``, ``viscosity``, ``rhoCp``, and
``conductivity`` fields from the ``.par`` file entirely. Then, in the ``.oudf`` kernels,
you must include kernels that apply the variable properties in the same manner as in
:ref:`constant_p`. See
:ref:`custom_properties` for more
information on the kernel setup.

.. _compute_backend_abstraction:

Compute Backend Abstraction (OCCA)
----------------------------------

To support different accelerator architectures, a compute backend abstraction
known as OCCA is used. OCCA provides a host abstraction layer for efficient
memory management and kernel execution. Additionally, it defines a unified
low-level kernel source code language. The ``okl`` syntax is similar to C, with
additional qualifiers. ``@kernel`` is used to define a compute kernel (return
type must be ``void``) and contains both an ``@outer`` and ``@inner``. The
``@inner`` loop bounds must be known at compile time. Registers have to be
defined as ``@exclusive`` or ``@shared``. Threads are synchronized with 
``@barrier()``. Note that a kernel cannot call any other kernels. What follows 
is an example:

.. code-block:: cpp

 @kernel void foo(const dlong Ntotal,
                  const dlong offset,
                  @restrict const dfloat* A,
                  @restrict const dfloat* B,
                  @restrict dfloat* OUT)
 {
   for(dlong b=0; b<(Ntotal+p_blockSize -1)/p_blockSize; ++b; @outer){
     for(dlong n=0; n< p_blockSize; ++n; @inner){
       const dlong id = b*p_blockSize + n;
       if(id < Ntotal){
         OUT[id + 0*offset] =  A[id]*B[id];
       }
     }
   }
 }

On the host, this kernel is launched by:

.. code-block:: cpp

 const dlong Nlocal = mesh->Nlocal;
 const dlong offset = 0;
 deviceMemory<dfloat> d_out(Nlocal);
 foo(Ntotal, offset, d_a, d_b, d_out);

Kernel launches look like regular function calls, but arrays must be passed as
``deviceMemory`` objects, and scalar value arguments (integer or floating point
numbers) must have exact type matches, as no implicit type conversion is
performed. Passing structs or pointers of any sort is currently not supported.
Execution of kernels will occur in order, but may be (depending on the backend)
asynchronous with respect to the host.

To transfer data between the device (abraction layer) and the host, 
``deviceMemory`` implements ``copyTo`` and ``copyFrom``. 

.. code-block:: cpp

 deviceMemory<dfloat> d_foo(Nlocal); 
 ...

 // copy device to host
 std::vector<dfloat> foo(d_size());
 d_foo.copyTo(foo);

 ....

 // copy host to device
 d.foo.copyFrom(foo);

This section describes commonly-used variables related to the mesh, which are all stored
on data structures of type ``mesh_t``. nekRS uses an archaic approach for conjugate heat
transfer applications, i.e. problems with separate fluid and solid domains. For problems
without conjugate heat transfer, all mesh information is stored on the ``nrs->mesh`` object,
while for problems with conjugate heat transfer, all mesh information is stored on the
``nrs->cds->mesh`` object. More information is available in the
:ref:`cht_mesh` section. To keep the following
summary table general, the variable names are referred to simply as living on the ``mesh``
object, without any differentiation between whether that ``mesh`` object is the object on
``nrs`` or ``nrs->cds``.

Some notable points of interest that require additional comment:

* The :term:`MPI<MPI>` communicator is stored on the mesh, since domain decomposition
  is used to divide the mesh among processes. *Most* information stored on the ``mesh`` object
  strictly refers to the portion of the mesh "owned" by the current process. For instance,
  ``mesh->Nelements`` only refers to the number of elements "owned" by the current process
  (``mesh->rank``), not the total number of elements in the simulation mesh. Any exceptions
  to this process-local information is noted as applicable.

.. _flow_vars:

Flow Solution Fields and Simulation Settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This section describes the members on the ``nrs`` object, which consist of user settings as well as the flow
solution. Some of this information is simply assigned a value also stored on the ``nrs->mesh`` object.
Some notable points that require additional comment:

* Like the mesh object, the solution fields are stored only on a per-rank basis. That is, ``nrs->U`` only
  contains the velocity solution for the elements "owned" by the current process.
* Solution arrays with more than one component (such as velocity, in ``nrs->U``) are indexed according
  to a ``fieldOffset``. This offset is chosen to be larger than the *actual* length of the velocity
  solution (which is the total number of quadrature points on that rank, or ``nrs->Nlocal``) due to
  performance reasons. That is, you should use the ``fieldOffset`` to index between components, but
  within a single component, you should not attempt to access entries with indices between
  ``i * (fieldOffset - Nlocal)``, where ``i`` is the component number, because those values are not actually
  used to store the solution (they are the end of a storage buffer).

Some members only exist on the device - in this case, the variable name shown in the first column
explicitly shows the ``o_`` prefix to differentiate that this member is not available in this form
on the host. For instance, the ``o_mue`` member is only available on the device - there is no
corresponding array ``nrs->mue`` member.

Passive Scalar Solution Fields and Simulation Settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This section describes the members on the ``cds`` object, which consist of user settings as well as the
passive scalar solution. Note that, from :ref:`flow_vars`,
the ``cds`` object is itself stored on the ``nrs`` flow solution object. Many of these members are
copied from the analogous variable on the ``nrs`` object. For instance, ``cds->fieldOffset`` is simply
set equal to ``nrs->fieldOffset``. In a few cases, however, the names on the ``cds`` object differ
from the analogous names on the ``nrs`` object, such as for ``cds->NSfields`` and ``nrs->Nscalar``, which
contain identical information.
